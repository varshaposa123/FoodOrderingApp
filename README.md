## Implementation 


### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - The frontend of our Food Ordering App is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We've also utilized React Router for navigation and Redux for state management.
  - We've styled the app using CSS and some components with styled-components for more dynamic styling.
  - Axios is used for making HTTP requests to our backend API.

- **Backend**:
  - Our backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a robust and flexible server environment.
  - For database management, we've employed PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database.
  - Data validation and authentication are handled using libraries like Joi and Passport.js.
  - The RESTful API design is used to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

### Architectural Choices

- **MVC Pattern**:
  - We've adopted the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for our backend, which helps in maintaining a structured codebase. Models handle data operations, views manage the user interface, and controllers act as intermediaries.

- **Client-Server Architecture**:
  - The Food Ordering App follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend and backend are separate entities, communicating via HTTP requests. This architecture allows for better scalability and modularity.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - We've implemented user registration and login features, ensuring that each user has a unique profile with personalized settings.

- **Restaurant Listings**:
  - Users can browse a comprehensive list of restaurants, view their menus, and access detailed information about each restaurant.

- **Order Placement**:
  - The app allows users to place food orders easily. They can add items to their cart, specify delivery details, and complete the order with a seamless checkout process.

- **Real-time Updates**:
  - Users can track the status of their orders in real time, from preparation to delivery, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **User Reviews and Ratings**:
  - We've integrated a review and rating system, enabling users to provide feedback on restaurants and their orders.

- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Restaurant owners have access to an admin dashboard where they can manage their menu items, review orders, and interact with customer feedback.

### Additional Information

- The project is version-controlled using Git, with a central repository hosted on GitHub.
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines are set up to automate testing and deployment processes.
- We aim to provide a delightful and user-friendly experience through a responsive and intuitive user interface.

## File Structure 

Certainly, here's an example of how you can structure the "File Structure" section in your README.md to provide an overview of the file structure of your Food Ordering App:

```markdown
## File Structure

The project is organized with the following file structure:



```plaintext
food-ordering-app/
│
├── App.js              # Main entry point for the app
│
├── assets/             # Static assets, such as images and fonts
│
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│
├── navigation/          # Navigation setup (e.g., React Navigation)
│
│── AddToCartScreen.js
│── HelpScreen.js
│── HotelSelectionScreen.js
│── LoginScreen.js
│── MenuSelectionScreen.js
│
├── AppNavigator.js      # App's main navigation configuration
│
├── services/            # Backend services, API calls, etc.
│
├── utils/               # Utility functions
│
├── package.json         # Project dependencies
│
├── README.md            # Project documentation
```

In this structure:

- `App.js` is your main entry point for the app.
- You have a `components` directory for reusable UI components.
- The `navigation` directory contains navigation-related code and setup.
- The `screens` directory contains the screens that are part of your main navigation flow.
- Screens that are not part of the main navigation flow, such as "AddToCartScreen" and "HelpScreen," are also included in the `screens` directory.
- `AppNavigator.js` is used to configure the main app navigation.
- The `services` directory is for backend services and API calls.
- The `utils` directory is for utility functions.

This structure separates your main app screens from screens that might be used separately or accessed through specific actions (e.g., "HelpScreen" or "AddToCartScreen"). It also keeps your main app entry point (`App.js`) at the root level of the project for better visibility.

This structure provides a clear separation between the frontend and backend components of your Food Ordering App. You can adapt and expand upon this structure to fit your project's specific needs. Feel free to add more details, such as the purpose of each directory or additional configuration files, depending on your project's complexity.
